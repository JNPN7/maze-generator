# Maze Generator
Use of spanning tree for path creation

## Problem
Not working due to random creation of edge in disjoint connection

## Idea to be implement
Take random node not visited.
Check if that random (disjoint) node has neighbour already visited or not
If visited then connect else take another random node until found

### Not a true spanning tree may contain loop


### Note
Make sure there is no disjoint network of nodes
